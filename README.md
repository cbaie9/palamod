**Palamod Renew** is a mod who recreates a very known French mod who still exist in 1.7.10 for nearly 10 years! (2014-2024)

So for fun, I recreate it with his most fun features

What's the mod adding?
The mod adds 6 types of ores:

- Amethyst (basic low-tier ores, useful for some craft)
- Titane (a little upgrade from the *Amethyst* but still low-tier)
- Paladium (good ore for most of the features of the mod, medium tier)
- Green Paladium (equal to the *Paladium* in terms of durability, damage, etc but it's a very rare variant you find in some biome)
- Findium (a crystal that doesn't have large use but some craft need it like cave block)
- Trixium (doesn't do anything but can be used for collection with /trixium command)
- Mixed Endium (a material that has excellent armor, can be crafted using *Endium Fragments* and *Green Paladium*)
- Endium (the rarest ore in the mod, cannot be mined but only be crafted or grown with the *orangeblue* or in the **crusher**)

They all have an armor and tool set (except for the Trixium and Findium)

There are some other amazing features:

 - 4 new types of wood (Jacaranda, Judeecercis, Erable and Ostrya) 
 - An unbreakable upgradable pickaxe: The **Pickaxe Of the Gods** (POG) 
 - A hammer that mines 3x3 and can duplicate (with the fortune
   enchantement) and smelt ore (with the smelt enchantment) 
  - An integrated admin shop with automatic transaction 
  - Some new biome with new structure in them 
  - It's own money system with /money /pay and unique block that can automate generating money 
  - Custom craft are shown in JEI
  - A little bit of storytelling
  
The mod was originally created in 2014 by FuzeIII for his modded Minecraft server, Paladium, but the mod was server-exclusive with a special launcher and solo was disabled to prevent people from finding bugs, exploits, and breaking the server (at the time, the server had a very high number of cheaters and hackers).

But players want to play solo with the mod (if you want to know how many people want to play solo, just type: "palamod solo" on YouTube 😉)

As I said, I recreated the mod from scratch, so even if you break the mod, you can't break the server (and it has several improvements like more hammers and a system to automate the admin shop and also having the latest Minecraft updates available)

→ No money was or will be made with the mod

→ I am not affiliated with Paladium, FuzeIII or Mojang (or even Microsoft).
